When a new Databricks project starts, the central IP team provisions the required infrastructure using Terraform and a Service Principal. This includes creating a Databricks workspace, a Unity Catalog linked to an External Location, and a Databricks group containing all project team members. Project teams must store all assets – e.g., tables and volumes, as Managed assets in Unity Catalog. This model hides infrastructure complexity while giving teams autonomy within their catalog. They can create and manage schemas, tables, volumes, and related objects but cannot rename, delete, or change catalog permissions, those remain under IT’s control.Which rights should the project group be granted to enable this model? 

A. The group needs to have USE CATALOG and USE SCHEMA on the catalog.

B. The group needs to have ALL PRIVILEGES and the MANAGE on the catalog.

C. The group needs to have ALL PRIVILEGES on the catalog.

D. The group should be made OWNER of the catalog.

A data engineer, while designing a Pandas UDF to process financial time series data with complex calculations that require maintaining state across rows within each stock symbol group must ensure the function is efficient and scalable.Which approach will solve the problem with minimum overhead while preserving data integrity? 

A. Use a SCALAR_ITER Pandas UDF with iterator-based processing, implementing state management through persistent storage (Delta tables) that gets updated after each batch to maintain continuity across iterator chunks.

B. Use a GROUPED_AGG UPF that processes each stock symbol group independently, maintaining state through intermediate aggregation results that get passed between successive UDF calls via broadcast variables.

C. Use a SCALAR Pandas UDF that processes the entire dataset at once, implementing custom partitioning logic within the UDF to group by stock symbol and maintain state using global variables shared across all executor processes.

D. Use ApplyInPandas method on spark dataframe that receives all rows for each stock symbol as a pandas DataFrame, allowing processing within each group while maintaining state variables local to each group’s processing function.

Question #: 73
Topic #: 1

[All Certified Data Engineer Professional Questions]

A Structured Streaming job deployed to production has been resulting in higher than expected cloud storage costs. At present, during normal execution, each microbatch of data is processed in less than 3s; at least 12 times per minute, a microbatch is processed that contains 0 records. The streaming write was configured using the default trigger settings. The production job is currently scheduled alongside many other Databricks jobs in a workspace with instance pools provisioned to reduce start-up time for jobs with batch execution.Holding all other variables constant and assuming records need to be processed in less than 10 minutes, which adjustment will meet the requirement? 

A. Set the trigger interval to 3 seconds; the default trigger interval is consuming too many records per batch, resulting in spill to disk that can increase volume costs.

B. Increase the number of shuffle partitions to maximize parallelism, since the trigger interval cannot be modified without modifying the checkpoint directory.

C. Set the trigger interval to 10 minutes; each batch calls APIs in the source storage account, so decreasing trigger frequency to maximum allowable threshold should minimize this cost.

D. Set the trigger interval to 500 milliseconds; setting a small but non-zero trigger interval ensures that the source is not queried too frequently.

E. Use the trigger once option and configure a Databricks job to execute the query every 10 minutes; this approach minimizes costs for both compute and storage.

Question #: 70
Topic #: 1

[All Certified Data Engineer Professional Questions]

A data ingestion task requires a one-TB JSON dataset to be written out to Parquet with a target part-file size of 512 MB. Because Parquet is being used instead of Delta Lake, built-in file-sizing features such as Auto-Optimize & Auto-Compaction cannot be used.Which strategy will yield the best performance without shuffling data? 

A. Set spark.sql.files.maxPartitionBytes to 512 MB, ingest the data, execute the narrow transformations, and then write to parquet.

B. Set spark.sql.shuffle.partitions to 2,048 partitions (1TB*1024*1024/512), ingest the data, execute the narrow transformations, optimize the data by sorting it (which automatically repartitions the data), and then write to parquet.

C. Set spark.sql.adaptive.advisoryPartitionSizeInBytes to 512 MB bytes, ingest the data, execute the narrow transformations, coalesce to 2,048 partitions (1TB*1024*1024/512), and then write to parquet.

D. Ingest the data, execute the narrow transformations, repartition to 2,048 partitions (1TB* 1024*1024/512), and then write to parquet.

E. Set spark.sql.shuffle.partitions to 512, ingest the data, execute the narrow transformations, and then write to parquet.

Question #: 49
Topic #: 1

[All Certified Data Engineer Professional Questions]

A user new to Databricks is trying to troubleshoot long execution times for some pipeline logic they are working on. Presently, the user is executing code cell-by-cell, using display() calls to confirm code is producing the logically correct results as new transformations are added to an operation. To get a measure of average time to execute, the user is running each cell multiple times interactively.Which of the following adjustments will get a more accurate measure of how code is likely to perform in production? 

A. Scala is the only language that can be accurately tested using interactive notebooks; because the best performance is achieved by using Scala code compiled to JARs, all PySpark and Spark SQL logic should be refactored.

B. The only way to meaningfully troubleshoot code execution times in development notebooks Is to use production-sized data and production-sized clusters with Run All execution.

C. Production code development should only be done using an IDE; executing code against a local build of open source Spark and Delta Lake will provide the most accurate benchmarks for how code will perform in production.

D. Calling display() forces a job to trigger, while many transformations will only add to the logical query plan; because of caching, repeated execution of the same logic does not provide meaningful results.

E. The Jobs UI should be leveraged to occasionally run the notebook as a job and track execution time during incremental code development because Photon can only be enabled on clusters launched for scheduled jobs.

A Structured Streaming job deployed to production has been experiencing delays during peak hours of the day. At present, during normal execution, each microbatch of data is processed in less than 3 seconds. During peak hours of the day, execution time for each microbatch becomes very inconsistent, sometimes exceeding 30 seconds. The streaming write is currently configured with a trigger interval of 10 seconds.Holding all other variables constant and assuming records need to be processed in less than 10 seconds, which adjustment will meet the requirement? 

A. Decrease the trigger interval to 5 seconds; triggering batches more frequently allows idle executors to begin processing the next batch while longer running tasks from previous batches finish.

B. Decrease the trigger interval to 5 seconds; triggering batches more frequently may prevent records from backing up and large batches from causing spill.

C. The trigger interval cannot be modified without modifying the checkpoint directory; to maintain the current stream state, increase the number of shuffle partitions to maximize parallelism.

D. Use the trigger once option and configure a Databricks job to execute the query every 10 seconds; this ensures all backlogged records are processed with each batch.

**Answer: B**

[All Certified Data Engineer Professional Questions]

In order to prevent accidental commits to production data, a senior data engineer has instituted a policy that all development work will reference clones of Delta Lake tables. After testing both DEEP and SHALLOW CLONE, development tables are created using SHALLOW CLONE.A few weeks after initial table creation, the cloned versions of several tables implemented as Type 1 Slowly Changing Dimension (SCD) stop working. The transaction logs for the source tables show that VACUUM was run the day before.Which statement describes why the cloned tables are no longer working? 

A. Because Type 1 changes overwrite existing records, Delta Lake cannot guarantee data consistency for cloned tables.

B. Running VACUUM automatically invalidates any shallow clones of a table; DEEP CLONE should always be used when a cloned table will be repeatedly queried.

C. The data files compacted by VACUUM are not tracked by the cloned metadata; running REFRESH on the cloned table will pull in recent changes.

D. The metadata created by the CLONE operation is referencing data files that were purged as invalid by the VACUUM command.

To reduce storage and compute costs, the data engineering team has been tasked with curating a series of aggregate tables leveraged by business intelligence dashboards, customer-facing applications, production machine learning models, and ad hoc analytical queries.The data engineering team has been made aware of new requirements from a customer-facing application, which is the only downstream workload they manage entirely. As a result, an aggregate table used by numerous teams across the organization will need to have a number of fields renamed, and additional fields will also be added.Which of the solutions addresses the situation while minimally interrupting other teams in the organization without increasing the number of tables that need to be managed? 

A. Send all users notice that the schema for the table will be changing; include in the communication the logic necessary to revert the new table schema to match historic queries.

B. Configure a new table with all the requisite fields and new names and use this as the source for the customer-facing application; create a view that maintains the original data schema and table name by aliasing select fields from the new table.

C. Create a new table with the required schema and new fields and use Delta Lake's deep clone functionality to sync up changes committed to one table to the corresponding table.

D. Replace the current table definition with a logical view defined with the query logic currently writing the aggregate table; create a new table to power the customer-facing application.

E. Add a table comment warning all users that the table schema and field names will be changing on a given date; overwrite the table in place to the specifications of the customer-facing application.

An hourly batch job is configured to ingest data files from a cloud object storage container where each batch represent all records produced by the source system in a given hour. The batch job to process these records into the Lakehouse is sufficiently delayed to ensure no late-arriving data is missed. The user_id field represents a unique key for the data, which has the following schema: user_id BIGINT, username STRING, user_utc STRING, user_region STRING, last_login BIGINT, auto_pay BOOLEAN, last_updated BIGINTNew records are all ingested into a table named account_history which maintains a full record of all data in the same schema as the source. The next table in the system is named account_current and is implemented as a Type 1 table representing the most recent value for each unique user_id.Assuming there are millions of user accounts and tens of thousands of records processed hourly, which implementation can be used to efficiently update the described account_current table as part of each hourly batch job? 

A. Use Auto Loader to subscribe to new files in the account_history directory; configure a Structured Streaming trigger once job to batch update newly detected files into the account_current table.

B. Overwrite the account_current table with each batch using the results of a query against the account_history table grouping by user_id and filtering for the max value of last_updated.

C. Filter records in account_history using the last_updated field and the most recent hour processed, as well as the max last_iogin by user_id write a merge statement to update or insert the most recent value for each user_id.

D. Use Delta Lake version history to get the difference between the latest version of account_history and one version prior, then write these records to account_current.

E. Filter records in account_history using the last_updated field and the most recent hour processed, making sure to deduplicate on username; write a merge statement to update or insert the most recent value for each username.

A user new to Databricks is trying to troubleshoot long execution times for some pipeline logic they are working on. Presently, the user is executing code cell-by-cell, using display() calls to confirm code is producing the logically correct results as new transformations are added to an operation. To get a measure of average time to execute, the user is running each cell multiple times interactively.Which of the following adjustments will get a more accurate measure of how code is likely to perform in production? 

A. The Jobs UI should be leveraged to occasionally run the notebook as a job and track execution time during incremental code development because Photon can only be enabled on clusters launched for scheduled jobs.

B. The only way to meaningfully troubleshoot code execution times in development notebooks is to use production-sized data and production-sized clusters with Run All execution.

C. Production code development should only be done using an IDE; executing code against a local build of open source Spark and Delta Lake will provide the most accurate benchmarks for how code will perform in production.

D. Calling display() forces a job to trigger, while many transformations will only add to the logical query plan; because of caching, repeated execution of the same logic does not provide meaningful results.

An hourly batch job is configured to ingest data files from a cloud object storage container where each batch represent all records produced by the source system in a given hour. The batch job to process these records into the Lakehouse is sufficiently delayed to ensure no late-arriving data is missed. The user_id field represents a unique key for the data, which has the following schema:user_id BIGINT, username STRING, user_utc STRING, user_region STRING, last_login BIGINT, auto_pay BOOLEAN, last_updated BIGINTNew records are all ingested into a table named account_history which maintains a full record of all data in the same schema as the source. The next table in the system is named account_current and is implemented as a Type 1 table representing the most recent value for each unique user_id.Which implementation can be used to efficiently update the described account_current table as part of each hourly batch job assuming there are millions of user accounts and tens of thousands of records processed hourly? 

A. Filter records in account_history using the last_updated field and the most recent hour processed, making sure to deduplicate on username; write a merge statement to update or insert the most recent value for each username.

B. Use Auto Loader to subscribe to new files in the account_history directory; configure a Structured Streaming trigger available job to batch update newly detected files into the account_current table.

C. Overwrite the account_current table with each batch using the results of a query against the account_history table grouping by user_id and filtering for the max value of last_updated.

D. Filter records in account_history using the last_updated field and the most recent hour processed, as well as the max last_login by user_id write a merge statement to update or insert the most recent value for each user_id.

An upstream system is emitting change data capture (CDC) logs that are being written to a cloud object storage directory. Each record in the log indicates the change type (insert, update, or delete) and the values for each field after the change. The source table has a primary key identified by the field pk_id.For auditing purposes, the data governance team wishes to maintain a full record of all values that have ever been valid in the source system. For analytical purposes, only the most recent value for each record needs to be recorded. The Databricks job to ingest these records occurs once per hour, but each individual record may have changed multiple times over the course of an hour.Which solution meets these requirements? 

A. Create a separate history table for each pk_id resolve the current state of the table by running a union all filtering the history tables for the most recent state.

B. Use MERGE INTO to insert, update, or delete the most recent entry for each pk_id into a bronze table, then propagate all changes throughout the system.

C. Iterate through an ordered set of changes to the table, applying each in turn; rely on Delta Lake's versioning ability to create an audit log.

D. Use Delta Lake's change data feed to automatically process CDC data from an external system, propagating all changes to all dependent tables in the Lakehouse.

E. Ingest all log information into a bronze table; use MERGE INTO to insert, update, or delete the most recent entry for each pk_id into a silver table to recreate the current table state.

The data engineering team has configured a job to process customer requests to be forgotten (have their data deleted). All user data that needs to be deleted is stored in Delta Lake tables using default table settings.The team has decided to process all deletions from the previous week as a batch job at 1am each Sunday. The total duration of this job is less than one hour. Every Monday at 3am, a batch job executes a series of VACUUM commands on all Delta Lake tables throughout the organization.The compliance officer has recently learned about Delta Lake's time travel functionality. They are concerned that this might allow continued access to deleted data.Assuming all delete logic is correctly implemented, which statement correctly addresses this concern? 

A. Because the VACUUM command permanently deletes all files containing deleted records, deleted records may be accessible with time travel for around 24 hours.

B. Because the default data retention threshold is 24 hours, data files containing deleted records will be retained until the VACUUM job is run the following day.

C. Because Delta Lake time travel provides full access to the entire history of a table, deleted records can always be recreated by users with full admin privileges.

D. Because Delta Lake's delete statements have ACID guarantees, deleted records will be permanently purged from all storage systems as soon as a delete job completes.

E. Because the default data retention threshold is 7 days, data files containing deleted records will be retained until the VACUUM job is run 8 days later.

The data engineering team is configuring environments for development, testing, and production before beginning migration on a new data pipeline. The team requires extensive testing on both the code and data resulting from code execution, and the team wants to develop and test against data as similar to production data as possible.A junior data engineer suggests that production data can be mounted to the development and testing environments, allowing pre-production code to execute against production data. Because all users have admin privileges in the development environment, the junior data engineer has offered to configure permissions and mount this data for the team.Which statement captures best practices for this situation? 

A. All development, testing, and production code and data should exist in a single, unified workspace; creating separate environments for testing and development complicates administrative overhead.

B. In environments where interactive code will be executed, production data should only be accessible with read permissions; creating isolated databases for each environment further reduces risks.

C. As long as code in the development environment declares USE dev_db at the top of each notebook, there is no possibility of inadvertently committing changes back to production data sources.

D. Because Delta Lake versions all data and supports time travel, it is not possible for user error or malicious actors to permanently delete production data; as such, it is generally safe to mount production data anywhere.

E. Because access to production data will always be verified using passthrough credentials, it is safe to mount data to any Databricks development environment.

Question #: 139
Topic #: 1

[All Certified Data Engineer Professional Questions]

A Structured Streaming job deployed to production has been resulting in higher than expected cloud storage costs. At present, during normal execution, each microbatch of data is processed in less than 3s; at least 12 times per minute, a microbatch is processed that contains 0 records. The streaming write was configured using the default trigger settings. The production job is currently scheduled alongside many other Databricks jobs in a workspace with instance pools provisioned to reduce start-up time for jobs with batch execution.Holding all other variables constant and assuming records need to be processed in less than 10 minutes, which adjustment will meet the requirement? 

A. Set the trigger interval to 3 seconds; the default trigger interval is consuming too many records per batch, resulting in spill to disk that can increase volume costs.

B. Use the trigger once option and configure a Databricks job to execute the query every 10 minutes; this approach minimizes costs for both compute and storage.

C. Set the trigger interval to 10 minutes; each batch calls APIs in the source storage account, so decreasing trigger frequency to maximum allowable threshold should minimize this cost.

D. Set the trigger interval to 500 milliseconds; setting a small but non-zero trigger interval ensures that the source is not queried too frequently.

A junior data engineer is working to implement logic for a Lakehouse table named silver_device_recordings. The source data contains 100 unique fields in a highly nested JSON structure.The silver_device_recordings table will be used downstream to power several production monitoring dashboards and a production model. At present, 45 of the 100 fields are being used in at least one of these applications.The data engineer is trying to determine the best approach for dealing with schema declaration given the highly-nested structure of the data and the numerous fields.Which of the following accurately presents information about Delta Lake and Databricks that may impact their decision-making process? 

A. The Tungsten encoding used by Databricks is optimized for storing string data; newly-added native support for querying JSON strings means that string types are always most efficient.

B. Because Delta Lake uses Parquet for data storage, data types can be easily evolved by just modifying file footer information in place.

C. Human labor in writing code is the largest cost associated with data engineering workloads; as such, automating table declaration logic should be a priority in all migration workloads.

D. Because Databricks will infer schema using types that allow all observed data to be processed, setting types manually provides greater assurance of data quality enforcement.

E. Schema inference and evolution on Databricks ensure that inferred types will always accurately match the data types used by downstream systems.

A Structured Streaming job deployed to production has been experiencing delays during peak hours of the day. At present, during normal execution, each microbatch of data is processed in less than 3 seconds. During peak hours of the day, execution time for each microbatch becomes very inconsistent, sometimes exceeding 30 seconds. The streaming write is currently configured with a trigger interval of 10 seconds.Holding all other variables constant and assuming records need to be processed in less than 10 seconds, which adjustment will meet the requirement? 

A. Decrease the trigger interval to 5 seconds; triggering batches more frequently allows idle executors to begin processing the next batch while longer running tasks from previous batches finish.

B. Increase the trigger interval to 30 seconds; setting the trigger interval near the maximum execution time observed for each batch is always best practice to ensure no records are dropped.

C. The trigger interval cannot be modified without modifying the checkpoint directory; to maintain the current stream state, increase the number of shuffle partitions to maximize parallelism.

D. Use the trigger once option and configure a Databricks job to execute the query every 10 seconds; this ensures all backlogged records are processed with each batch.

E. Decrease the trigger interval to 5 seconds; triggering batches more frequently may prevent records from backing up and large batches from causing spill.

A table in the Lakehouse named customer_churn_params is used in churn prediction by the machine learning team. The table contains information about customers derived from a number of upstream sources. Currently, the data engineering team populates this table nightly by overwriting the table with the current valid values derived from upstream data sources.The churn prediction model used by the ML team is fairly stable in production. The team is only interested in making predictions on records that have changed in the past 24 hours.Which approach would simplify the identification of these changed records? 

A. Apply the churn model to all rows in the customer_churn_params table, but implement logic to perform an upsert into the predictions table that ignores rows where predictions have not changed.

B. Convert the batch job to a Structured Streaming job using the complete output mode; configure a Structured Streaming job to read from the customer_churn_params table and incrementally predict against the churn model.

C. Calculate the difference between the previous model predictions and the current customer_churn_params on a key identifying unique customers before making new predictions; only make predictions on those customers not in the previous predictions.

D. Modify the overwrite logic to include a field populated by calling spark.sql.functions.current_timestamp() as data are being written; use this field to identify records written on a particular date.

E. Replace the current overwrite logic with a merge statement to modify only those records that have changed; write logic to make predictions on the changed records identified by the change data feed.

[All Certified Data Engineer Professional Questions]

A data engineering team is in the process of migrating off its legacy Hadcop platform. As part of the process, they are evaluating the different storage formats to see which offers the best query performance. Their legacy platform utilizes ORC and RCFile formats. They converted a subset of their data to Delta Lake and ran a side-by-side benchmark, and found that their queries performed significantly better. Upon investigation, they discovered that the query plans were different, and the queries that read from the Delta Lake tables leveraged a Shuffle HashJoin, whereas the legacy formats used Sort Merge Joins. The queries that read from the Delta Lake tables also read less data.Which reason could be attributed to the difference in query performance? 

A. The queries against the ORC tables leveraged the dynamic data skipping optimization but not the dynamic file pruning optimization.

B. The queries against the Delta Lake tables were able to leverage the dynamic file pruning optimization.

C. Delta Lake enables data skipping and file pruning using a vectorized Parquet reader.

D. Shuffle Hash Joins are always more efficient than Sort Merge Joins.

The following code has been migrated to a Databricks notebook from a legacy workload:The code executes successfully and provides the logically correct results, however, it takes over 20 minutes to extract and load around 1 GB of data.Which statement is a possible explanation for this behavior? 

A. %sh triggers a cluster restart to collect and install Git. Most of the latency is related to cluster startup time.

B. Instead of cloning, the code should use %sh pip install so that the Python code can get executed in parallel across all nodes in a cluster.

C. %sh does not distribute file moving operations; the final line of code should be updated to use %fs instead.

D. %sh executes shell code on the driver node. The code does not take advantage of the worker nodes or Databricks optimized Spark.

[All Certified Data Engineer Professional Questions]

The data engineering team is migrating an enterprise system with thousands of tables and views into the Lakehouse. They plan to implement the target architecture using a series of bronze, silver, and gold tables. Bronze tables will almost exclusively be used by production data engineering workloads, while silver tables will be used to support both data engineering and machine learning workloads. Gold tables will largely serve business intelligence and reporting purposes. While personal identifying information (PII) exists in all tiers of data, pseudonymization and anonymization rules are in place for all data at the silver and gold levels.The organization is interested in reducing security concerns while maximizing the ability to collaborate across diverse teams.Which statement exemplifies best practices for implementing this system? 

A. Isolating tables in separate databases based on data quality tiers allows for easy permissions management through database ACLs and allows physical separation of default storage locations for managed tables.

B. Because databases on Databricks are merely a logical construct, choices around database organization do not impact security or discoverability in the Lakehouse.

C. Storing all production tables in a single database provides a unified view of all data assets available throughout the Lakehouse, simplifying discoverability by granting all users view privileges on this database.

D. Working in the default Databricks database provides the greatest security when working with managed tables, as these will be created in the DBFS root.

An upstream system is emitting change data capture (CDC) logs that are being written to a cloud object storage directory. Each record in the log indicates the change type (insert, update, or delete) and the values for each field after the change. The source table has a primary key identified by the field pk_id.For auditing purposes, the data governance team wishes to maintain a full record of all values that have ever been valid in the source system. For analytical purposes, only the most recent value for each record needs to be recorded. The Databricks job to ingest these records occurs once per hour, but each individual record may have changed multiple times over the course of an hour.Which solution meets these requirements? 

A. Iterate through an ordered set of changes to the table, applying each in turn to create the current state of the table, (insert, update, delete), timestamp of change, and the values.

B. Use merge into to insert, update, or delete the most recent entry for each pk_id into a table, then propagate all changes throughout the system.

C. Deduplicate records in each batch by pk_id and overwrite the target table.

D. Use Delta Lake’s change data feed to automatically process CDC data from an external system, propagating all changes to all dependent tables in the Lakehouse.

[All Certified Data Engineer Professional Questions]

A Delta lake table with CDF enabled table in the Lakehouse named customer_churn_params is used in churn prediction by the machine learning team. The table contains information about customers derived from a number of upstream sources. Currently, the data engineering team populates this table nightly by overwriting the table with the current valid values derived from upstream data sources.The churn prediction model used by the ML team is fairly stable in production. The team is only interested in making predictions on records that have changed in the past 24 hours.Which approach would simplify the identification of these changed records? 

A. Apply the churn model to all rows in the customer_churn_params table, but implement logic to perform an upsert into the predictions table that ignores rows where predictions have not changed.

B. Convert the batch job to a Structured Streaming job using the complete output mode; configure a Structured Streaming job to read from the customer_churn_params table and incrementally predict against the churn model.

C. Replace the current overwrite logic with a merge statement to modify only those records that have changed; write logic to make predictions on the changed records identified by the change data feed.

D. Modify the overwrite logic to include a field populated by calling spark.sql.functions.current_timestamp() as data are being written; use this field to identify records written on a particular date.

The business intelligence team has a dashboard configured to track various summary metrics for retail stores. This includes total sales for the previous day alongside totals and averages for a variety of time periods. The fields required to populate this dashboard have the following schema:For demand forecasting, the Lakehouse contains a validated table of all itemized sales updated incrementally in near real-time. This table, named products_per_order, includes the following fields:Because reporting on long-term sales trends is less volatile, analysts using the new dashboard only require data to be refreshed once daily. Because the dashboard will be queried interactively by many users throughout a normal business day, it should return results quickly and reduce total compute associated with each materialization.Which solution meets the expectations of the end users while controlling and limiting possible costs? 

A. Populate the dashboard by configuring a nightly batch job to save the required values as a table overwritten with each update.

B. Use Structured Streaming to configure a live dashboard against the products_per_order table within a Databricks notebook.

C. Define a view against the products_per_order table and define the dashboard against this view.

D. Use the Delta Cache to persist the products_per_order table in memory to quickly update the dashboard with each query.

The data engineering team has configured a job to process customer requests to be forgotten (have their data deleted). All user data that needs to be deleted is stored in Delta Lake tables using default table settings.The team has decided to process all deletions from the previous week as a batch job at 1am each Sunday. The total duration of this job is less than one hour. Every Monday at 3am, a batch job executes a series of VACUUM commands on all Delta Lake tables throughout the organization.The compliance officer has recently learned about Delta Lake's time travel functionality. They are concerned that this might allow continued access to deleted data.Assuming all delete logic is correctly implemented, which statement correctly addresses this concern? 

A. Because the VACUUM command permanently deletes all files containing deleted records, deleted records may be accessible with time travel for around 24 hours.

B. Because the default data retention threshold is 24 hours, data files containing deleted records will be retained until the VACUUM job is run the following day.

C. Because the default data retention threshold is 7 days, data files containing deleted records will be retained until the VACUUM job is run 8 days later.

D. Because Delta Lake's delete statements have ACID guarantees, deleted records will be permanently purged from all storage systems as soon as a delete job completes.

A data architect has heard about Delta Lake’s built-in versioning and time travel capabilities. For auditing purposes, they have a requirement to maintain a full record of all valid street addresses as they appear in the customers table.The architect is interested in implementing a Type 1 table, overwriting existing records with new values and relying on Delta Lake time travel to support long-term auditing. A data engineer on the project feels that a Type 2 table will provide better performance and scalability.Which piece of information is critical to this decision? 

A. Data corruption can occur if a query fails in a partially completed state because Type 2 tables require setting multiple fields in a single update.

B. Shallow clones can be combined with Type 1 tables to accelerate historic queries for long-term versioning.

C. Delta Lake time travel cannot be used to query previous versions of these tables because Type 1 changes modify data files in place.

D. Delta Lake time travel does not scale well in cost or latency to provide a long-term versioning solution.

E. Delta Lake only supports Type 0 tables; once records are inserted to a Delta Lake table, they cannot be modified.

The source system uses a star schema, leveraging foreign key constraints and multi-table inserts to validate records on write.Which consideration will impact the decisions made by the engineer while migrating this workload? 

A. Databricks only allows foreign key constraints on hashed identifiers, which avoid collisions in highly-parallel writes.

B. Databricks supports Spark SQL and JDBC; all logic can be directly migrated from the source system without refactoring.

C. Committing to multiple tables simultaneously requires taking out multiple table locks and can lead to a state of deadlock.

D. All Delta Lake transactions are ACID compliant against a single table, and Databricks does not enforce foreign key constraints.

E. Foreign keys must reference a primary key field; multi-table inserts must leverage Delta Lake’s upsert functionality.

[All Certified Data Engineer Professional Questions]

The data engineering team is migrating an enterprise system with thousands of tables and views into the Lakehouse. They plan to implement the target architecture using a series of bronze, silver, and gold tables. Bronze tables will almost exclusively be used by production data engineering workloads, while silver tables will be used to support both data engineering and machine learning workloads. Gold tables will largely serve business intelligence and reporting purposes. While personal identifying information (PII) exists in all tiers of data, pseudonymization and anonymization rules are in place for all data at the silver and gold levels.The organization is interested in reducing security concerns while maximizing the ability to collaborate across diverse teams.Which statement exemplifies best practices for implementing this system? 

A. Isolating tables in separate databases based on data quality tiers allows for easy permissions management through database ACLs and allows physical separation of default storage locations for managed tables.

B. Because databases on Databricks are merely a logical construct, choices around database organization do not impact security or discoverability in the Lakehouse.

C. Storing all production tables in a single database provides a unified view of all data assets available throughout the Lakehouse, simplifying discoverability by granting all users view privileges on this database.

D. Working in the default Databricks database provides the greatest security when working with managed tables, as these will be created in the DBFS root.

E. Because all tables must live in the same storage containers used for the database they're created in, organizations should be prepared to create between dozens and thousands of databases depending on their data isolation requirements.

A new data engineer notices that a critical field was omitted from an application that writes its Kafka source to Delta Lake. This happened even though the critical field was in the Kafka source. That field was further missing from data written to dependent, long-term storage. The retention threshold on the Kafka service is seven days. The pipeline has been in production for three months.Which describes how Delta Lake can help to avoid data loss of this nature in the future? 

A. The Delta log and Structured Streaming checkpoints record the full history of the Kafka producer.

B. Delta Lake schema evolution can retroactively calculate the correct value for newly added fields, as long as the data was in the original source.

C. Delta Lake automatically checks that all fields present in the source data are included in the ingestion layer.

D. Data can never be permanently dropped or deleted from Delta Lake, so data loss is not possible under any circumstance.

E. Ingesting all raw data and metadata from Kafka to a bronze Delta table creates a permanent, replayable history of the data state.

The data governance team is reviewing code used for deleting records for compliance with GDPR. The following logic has been implemented to propagate delete requests from the user_lookup table to the user_aggregates table.Assuming that user_id is a unique identifying key and that all users that have requested deletion have been removed from the user_lookup table, which statement describes whether successfully executing the above logic guarantees that the records to be deleted from the user_aggregates table are no longer accessible and why? 

A. No; the Delta Lake DELETE command only provides ACID guarantees when combined with the MERGE INTO command.

B. No; files containing deleted records may still be accessible with time travel until a VACUUM command is used to remove invalidated data files.

C. No; the change data feed only tracks inserts and updates, not deleted records.

D. Yes; Delta Lake ACID guarantees provide assurance that the DELETE command succeeded fully and permanently purged these records.

The data engineering team is configuring environments for development, testing, and production before beginning migration on a new data pipeline. The team requires extensive testing on both the code and data resulting from code execution, and the team wants to develop and test against data as similar to production data as possible.A junior data engineer suggests that production data can be mounted to the development and testing environments, allowing pre-production code to execute against production data. Because all users have admin privileges in the development environment, the junior data engineer has offered to configure permissions and mount this data for the team.Which statement captures best practices for this situation? 

A. All development, testing, and production code and data should exist in a single, unified workspace; creating separate environments for testing and development complicates administrative overhead.

B. In environments where interactive code will be executed, production data should only be accessible with read permissions; creating isolated databases for each environment further reduces risks.

C. Because access to production data will always be verified using passthrough credentials, it is safe to mount data to any Databricks development environment.

D. Because Delta Lake versions all data and supports time travel, it is not possible for user error or malicious actors to permanently delete production data; as such, it is generally safe to mount production data anywhere.

In order to prevent accidental commits to production data, a senior data engineer has instituted a policy that all development work will reference clones of Delta Lake tables. After testing both DEEP and SHALLOW CLONE, development tables are created using SHALLOW CLONE.A few weeks after initial table creation, the cloned versions of several tables implemented as Type 1 Slowly Changing Dimension (SCD) stop working. The transaction logs for the source tables show that VACUUM was run the day before.Which statement describes why the cloned tables are no longer working? 

A. Because Type 1 changes overwrite existing records, Delta Lake cannot guarantee data consistency for cloned tables.

B. Running VACUUM automatically invalidates any shallow clones of a table; DEEP CLONE should always be used when a cloned table will be repeatedly queried.

C. Tables created with SHALLOW CLONE are automatically deleted after their default retention threshold of 7 days.

D. The metadata created by the CLONE operation is referencing data files that were purged as invalid by the VACUUM command.

E. The data files compacted by VACUUM are not tracked by the cloned metadata; running REFRESH on the cloned table will pull in recent changes.

An upstream source writes Parquet data as hourly batches to directories named with the current date. A nightly batch job runs the following code to ingest all data from the previous day as indicated by the date variable:Assume that the fields customer_id and order_id serve as a composite key to uniquely identify each order.If the upstream system is known to occasionally produce duplicate entries for a single order hours apart, which statement is correct? 

A. Each write to the orders table will only contain unique records, and only those records without duplicates in the target table will be written.

B. Each write to the orders table will only contain unique records, but newly written records may have duplicates already present in the target table.

C. Each write to the orders table will only contain unique records; if existing records with the same key are present in the target table, these records will be overwritten.

D. Each write to the orders table will only contain unique records; if existing records with the same key are present in the target table, the operation will fail.

E. Each write to the orders table will run deduplication over the union of new and existing records, ensuring no duplicate records are present.
